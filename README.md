# ATLAcharSheet
A program for a character sheet for our ATLA pseudo DND campaign.
The charSheet.cc file is the code for the program and charSheet.cpp is the compiled version of the code.
charSheetTemplate is a WIP on how I think I'll have the program lay out all the information, though that is subject to change at any time.



WARNING: This was made in Linux and interacts with files. As such if you want to try this out in Windows make sure to change and "/" in addresses to files into "\\\\"
