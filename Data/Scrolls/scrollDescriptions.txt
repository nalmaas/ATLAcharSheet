Using a focused torrent of water, you blast an enemy from 20/40 feet, dealing 6d4 water damage.
As a reaction, you pull up a water shield that can deflect or stop an incoming attack.
Lashing out at nearby objects or people, the water whip deals 6d4 water damage.  If the targetâ€™s fortitude is at or below 13, you may instead have the whip pull the target 10 feet closer.
