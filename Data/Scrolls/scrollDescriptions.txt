Unleashing a broad, unfocused blast of air, you deal 3d4 air damage within 20/40 feet.
Using a powerful, precise burst of air, anyone within a 15 foot line must make a DC 13 Willpower saving throw, being knocked back 10 feet and falling prone on a failed save. If a target hits a solid object, including another person, they take 3d4 strike damage.
